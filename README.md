## Roadmap
So far, this app can:
* Display a grid of data to copy
* Copy hard-coded text to the clipboard

To do:
* Add and edit the text items to be copied, through buttons on the main window
* Text file and/or SQLite data access
* (Longer Term): Integrate into a larger application, such as an IT Service Desk app, with features like:
    * A notepad that automatically saves what you type
    * An app that keeps a store of quick reference documentation, editable by some and read-only by others, in a multi-user environment
