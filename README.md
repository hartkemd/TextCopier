## Installation Instructions
None yet.

## How to Use
To do.

## Roadmap
I want to be able to:
* Add and edit pieces of text that I can then copy to the clipboard
* Copy desired text to the clipboard quickly, with one button click
* Longer Term: Integrate into a larger application, such as an IT Service Desk app, with features like:
    * A notepad that automatically saves what you type
    * An app that keeps a store of quick reference documentation, editable by some and read-only by others, in a multi-user environment
