## Roadmap
### Features Implemented:
* Users can view a DataGrid of text to copy, with buttons to copy text to the clipboard.
* Users can create, read, update, and delete items using text file data access. This uses CSV files, so text cannot currently contain commas.
* Users can clear the selected item in the DataGrid and the text boxes.
* Users can move items in the DataGrid up and down (with buttons).
* Users can sort the items in the DataGrid from A to Z.

### To Do:
* Implement SQLite data access, so we don't have to worry about commas in the data.
* (Longer Term): Integrate into a larger application, such as an IT Service Desk app, with features like:
    * A notepad that automatically saves what you type
    * An app that keeps a store of quick reference documentation, editable by some and read-only by others, in a multi-user environment
